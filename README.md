# movingShapes
This repository contains a small program named Moving Shapes.

This is a fun and compact GUI that allows a user to add and remove three Swing shapes to a subwindow. Once added, these shapes move automatically from the left to the right of the screen. The subwindow may be controlled entirely from the main window. Download the source files and run the Driver to see for yourself!
